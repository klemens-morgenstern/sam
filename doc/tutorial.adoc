## When should I use this?

`asio` itself bring synchronization mechanism, mainly strands, 
that will assure there's no overlap between two async operations.

This however only works if the entire operation is to be locked,
as it does not give the user finer tools to have exclusive access
only for some time during the operation.

This is the gap this library fills, i.e. giving a user tools to
synchronize parts of composed operations where this fine-tuning is needed.

E.g. to implement a connection pool, where we only lock acquiring the connection object,
but not the entire op.

Another use case is for synchronizing completions.

## Semaphore example

The semaphore is the simplest synchronization method,
it allows notifying workers trying to acquire a resource.

[source,cpp]
----
asio::awaitable<void> work(sam::semaphore & sem)
{
    co_await sem.async_acquire(asio::use_awaitable);
    co_await do_work();
}

.Threading Mode
****
Sam deduces the threading mode from the executor following
the concurrency_hint by asio, unless explicitly set.

The objects allow setting the concurrency_hint manually, as well.

See the
https://www.boost.org/doc/libs/master/doc/html/boost_asio/overview/core/concurrency_hint.html[
asio reference] for details.

In the documentation we'll refer to the mode as single-threaded and multi-threaded mode.
